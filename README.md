**Project Abstract:**
A current problem that researchers involved in bee taxonomy face is the access and retrieval of relevant information for specific queries given the vast and often scattered nature of the data. In this project, our team developed a domain-specific chatbot, nicknamed Chat G-Bee-T that is designed to support taxonomic research at our advising organization, the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity & Ecological Restoration and beyond. In the process, we developed a data pipeline that would standardize the vastly different data sources we were provided and funneled it all into a vector database that enabled the chatbot to return grounded and accurate responses to user queries using retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Through evaluation by experts at the Cheadle Center, Chat G-Bee-T performed well in clarity and accuracy and while potential for improvement is present, the result of this project represents a significant improvement over baseline large language model (LLM) performance.
